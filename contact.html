        <li>You always went for the Physical Challenge and you know you would have won if you were ever on <em>Double Dare</em>. Also you knew all the words to the Nikelodeon theme song. Plus hearing "Happy, Happy, Joy Joy" made you happy.</li>
        <li>Arguments over which system was better (Sega or Nintendo) broke out on the playground.</li>
